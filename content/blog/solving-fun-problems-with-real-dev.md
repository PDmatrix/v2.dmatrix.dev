Hello everyone! [👋]{.emoji}
 
Today, I want to tell you about a cool project called [**Real Dev**](https://real.dev)

![Main page](/images/uploads/solving-fun-problems-with-real-dev__main.png "Main page")
 
Real Dev is a platform for solving _real world-like_ problems, for example, creating backend API for a frontend application and so on. It's a great way to sharpen your skills as a software developer. Also, it can be used to improve your portfolio! If you like to solve programming puzzles, but you tired of algorithms and math you will like this project. [😊]{.emoji}
 
To solve problems you start with picking a task. For now, there are only ten tasks, but in the future, there will be much more. Every task has its level of complexity from _easy_ to _hard_. 
 
![Tasks](/images/uploads/solving-fun-problems-with-real-dev__tasks.png "Tasks")

There are currently two main languages to write:
 
* `Python`
* `JavaScript` (or `TypeScript`)
 
If it is not enough, you can use `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose`. This means, that you can write code in pretty much any programming language as long as you can run it via `docker`.
 
To get started, you need:
 
1. Register account on the [official website](https://real.dev)
2. Download and install the [CLI](https://real.dev/docs#cli-the-real-command)
3. Login via `CLI` using `real login`
4. [Pick a task](https://real.dev/tasks) and start solving it
 
If you encounter problems or you have questions, you can address well-written documentation. If you still have problems, you can either directly write to the tech-support using a little bubble in the right-bottom of the site or you can create an issue in [GitHub](https://github.com/real-dev/real/issues). 

I suggest you start with [Hello real world](https://real.dev/task/hello-real-world) task, as it helps you to get familiar with the whole process of submitting a task. After that, you can pick any task that you want and solve it using your _favorite programming language_.
 
I liked this experience. I am planning to continue solving tasks when new ones will come out. By far, my favorite task was [Host My Stuff](https://real.dev/task/host-my-stuff). At first, I thought that it is a very hard task and I doubted that I could solve it. But in the end, it was not that difficult. I encourage you to try solving all tasks on your own because doing that helps you practice a **problem-solving** skill.
 
Although this project in an early stage, it looks very promising and I am looking forward to its development!
 
P.S. I am very proud of the fact that I am the first person that completed all of the tasks in three days. Here's a picture of the current leaderboard:
