description: Solving fun problems with Real Dev, great project for programmers!
---

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Today, I want to tell you about a cool project called [**Real Dev**](https://real.dev)

![Main page](@assets/images/blog/solving-fun-problems-with-real-dev/main.png "Main page")

Real Dev is a platform for solving _real world-like_ problems, for example, creating backend API for a frontend application and so on. It's a great way to sharpen your skills as a software developer. Also, it can be used to improve your portfolio! If you like to solve programming puzzles, but you tired of algorithms and math you will like this project. ðŸ˜Š

To solve problems you start with picking a task. For now, there are only twelve tasks, but in the future, there will be much more. Every task has its level of complexity from _easy_ to _hard_.

![Tasks](@assets/images/blog/solving-fun-problems-with-real-dev/tasks.png "Tasks")

There are currently three main languages to write:

- `Python`
- `JavaScript` (or `TypeScript`)
- `Go`

If it is not enough, you can use `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose`. This means, that you can write code in pretty much any programming language as long as you can run it via `docker`.

To get started, you need:

1. Register account on the [official website](https://real.dev)
2. Download and install the [CLI](https://real.dev/docs#cli-the-real-command)
3. Login via `CLI` using `real login`
4. [Pick a task](https://real.dev/tasks) and start solving it

If you encounter problems or you have questions, you can address well-written documentation. If you still have problems, you can either directly write to the tech-support using a little bubble in the right-bottom of the site or you can create an issue in [GitHub](https://github.com/real-dev/real/issues).

I suggest you start with [Hello real world](https://real.dev/task/hello-real-world) task, as it helps you to get familiar with the whole process of submitting a task. After that, you can pick any task that you want and solve it using your _favorite programming language_.

I liked this experience. I am planning to continue solving tasks when new ones will come out. By far, my favorite task was [Host My Stuff](https://real.dev/task/host-my-stuff). At first, I thought that it is a very hard task and I doubted that I could solve it. But in the end, it was not that difficult. I encourage you to try solving all tasks on your own because doing that helps you practice a **problem-solving** skill.

Although this project in an early stage, it looks very promising and I am looking forward to its development!

P.S. I am very proud of the fact that I am the first person that completed all of the tasks in three days. Here's a picture of the current leaderboard:
