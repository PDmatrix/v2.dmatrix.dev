Hello, stranger.

I don't know how you ended up here, maybe you were looking for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions and stumbled upon this page, or maybe you opened this post on purpose because you're interested. Either way, welcome to my blog!

## The Past

I've been thinking about having a personal blog for a long time. I think it's cool to have a place where you can share your thoughts and have 100% control over what you post. At the time I was a big fan of `React` and of course, **Dan Abramov**. When I saw that he'd created [his own blog](https://overreacted.io/) I've thought to myself: "Wow, I want that too".

And I've made it using the [same template](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) as Dan. I've [tweaked](https://github.com/PDmatrix/dmatrix.dev/commit/087c66a850252a948a6430684bb3e96ba14c39e8) [a few](https://github.com/PDmatrix/dmatrix.dev/commit/e10bdc508947e79182b2ff8ae17140c8eaef11ee) [things](https://github.com/PDmatrix/dmatrix.dev/commit/87f2e4aeefd306e959b4bfc13acfb0068fd128f7) and connected it to the [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting.

I liked most of it and managed to write a few posts, but something was missing. It was **too simple**. And I've wanted more complex stuff like `MDX` and `TypeScript` instead of `JavaScript` and other stuff.

And around that time I've started to build a new version of my blog with fancy stuff like `Next.js`, `Vercel`, posts with `MDX` instead of plain `Markdown` and so on.

And I've got [somewhat working stage](https://github.com/PDmatrix/v2.dmatrix.dev/tree/8f61c330c086a11b75e1734798bada10c4331f1b), but there was a lot of work to be done.

I think that this project became **too complex** for a simple static blog, and that's why I've stopped building it. And because I was little bit disappointed, I also stopped writing posts on my old blog.

## The Present

The thought of having my own personal blog has never left me, so I have been researching about it from time to time. And recently I've discovered [Astro](https://astro.build/) for creating static websites and [AstroPaper](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/) for blog template.

Something clicked in me and I started working on the new version of my blog using these technologies.

And this time, I've managed to build +/- optimal solution for me. And I think that if it suits me, then it is already a big step forward.

Here's what [I have at the moment](https://github.com/PDmatrix/v2.dmatrix.dev):

- Customized [AstroPaper](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/) template to suit my needs.
- Automatic deploy to `Cloudflare Pages`.
- Motivation to write new posts.

## The Future

I plan to continue writing posts, I have several topics in mind. There are also some improvements I want to make to this blog:

- Use [code-hike](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike) for syntax highlighting. Currently it [doesn't have Astro support](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike/issues/255), but there is a possibility that this will be fixed eventually.
- Tweak here and there, but nothing too serious.
- Maybe add some CMS, but I have some doubts about that.
- Continue writing about my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I hope everything goes according to plan. If it doesn't, well, that's life.
